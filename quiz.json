The network will support 20 workstations, scattered throughout the building, to run an inventory database application. The two most distant computers are 150 meters apart. The primary goal for the network design is to connect all 20 workstations to a single LAN running at 1 gigabit per second (Gbps). The two secondary goals are to provide sufficient fault tolerance for a single cable break to occur without affecting the entire network and to provide resistance to the electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by machinery in the building. The earlier design calls for a CAT 6 UTP Ethernet LAN in a star/hub and spoke topology with all of the computers connected to a single switch.

    "question": "You are an IT consultant who has been contracted to install new computers on a client's Gigabit Ethernet network. You want the performance of the new computers to be as good as it can be, so you configure their network adapters to run at the full speed of 1 Gbps and to use full-duplex communication. You test the computers after installing them, and they function well. However, once the computers are in service, you begin getting complaints from the client of extremely poor network performance on the new machines. You return to the site that evening and run some ping tests, but you do not detect any problem. You call in a colleague to perform a protocol analysis, and she detects large numbers of packet collisions, late collisions, cyclical redundancy check (CRC) errors, and runt frames.
